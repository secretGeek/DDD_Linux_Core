<!-- The higgins slide presenter, licensed MS-PL, by Leon Bambrick, http://secretGeek.net -->
<!-- Get your own higgins from http://higgins.CodePlex.com -->
<!-- Put your collection of slides here... -->

<div class='slide'>
<p>This is higgins. A simple slide viewer.</p>
<p>Press F11 to go full screen</p>
<img src='image/higgins_logo.png'>
<p>Press space to go to the next slide.</p>

</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>Write your slides in plain Html.</p>
<p>You can also use the arrow keys to move forward or backward.</p>
<p>(Or click anywhere to go forward)</p>
<p>Move forward again. &raquo;</p>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>Each slide is a <code>div</code> with a class of <code>slide</code>.</p>
<p>They look like this:</p>
<blockquote style='text-align:left'>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div class='slide'&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;This is a simple slide viewer.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Press space to go to the next slide.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;
</blockquote> 
</div>

<div class='slide kapow'>
 <p>Add css classes to your slides<br />
 to change their appearance.</p>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
 <p>You can include notes with any slide.<br />
 See that little 'n' in the top right?<br />
 click that to show the notes for a slide.</p>

<span class='notes'>
<p>Notes are shown in a smaller font as they are really for the benefit of the presenter not the audience.</p>
<p>They can be a helpful cue for what to say on each slide.</p>
<p>To include notes for a slide, just include an element (such as a span) with a class of notes. Notes are hidden by default.</p>
<p>Click the 'n' again to hide the notes. (Or just move to the next slide.)</p></span>

</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>I built this tool for a talk at <a href='http://meetup.com'>Brisbane Alt.net</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't have powerpoint on my netbook, and wanted to be able to write the slides while on the bus.</p>
